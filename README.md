 <summary><h3>üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Olga's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming and math world - mathematics, code, linux, theory, languages and etc.. In the middle of studieng I felt a desire to excel in Java. I wanted more and needed a mentor in my coding journey. All this landed me a back-end software engineering job. My first job as intern was in EMC (Dell EMC) company. I developed storage array performance testing tool and insteased my knowlidge about Java, SQL, JUnit testing, project's life and how to be a good team member. After internship I started working full-time for EMC (Dell EMC). I worked on a storage array sizing tool. I improved and updated the configuration and sizing algorithm to cover new features of updated storage arrays. Apart from that, I developed a tool used for reports generating. These reports describe condition and utilisation of elements and devices of a storage array. This reduced the time of report generation (which was formerly done manually) from 2 weeks to 5 minutes. During this project I gained deep understanding about storage arrays internals and passed EMC SPEED Performance Guru exam. I also took part in DellEMC student program as a mentor. After Dell EMC company I started working on Cardpay company (a FinTech company). I worked on one of the core payment teams. I developed a reverse-proxy service responsible for mobile clients applications' integrity and security vulnerability checks and a part Mobile API which unlocked integrations with Android/iOS applications. This project unblocked signing of multiple contracts for the company. I led a team of 6 developers/test engineers and 2 analysts on several cross-functional projects which added support of different payment platforms. This included team and department roadmap planning, team staffing, mentorship of junior and middle engineers, cross-team collaboration with Security, Legal, Product and Design teams. Implementing these projects opened new streams of customers from LATAM and EMEA regions and increased department ARR. Of cause I have a dream of building my own app and help young developers to find their own way in this journew and level up their skills!
