 <summary><h3>👩🏻‍💻 Olga's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
 
I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about programming and the world of maths - mathematics, code, linux, theory and languages etc.  In the middle of my studies, I felt a desire to excel in Java; I wanted to understand a live projects work and needed a mentor on my coding journey. 
 
I subsequently landed my first job as an intern at EMC (Dell EMC) as a back-end software engineer where I worked under a mentor. There, I developed a storage array performance testing tool and increased my knowledge of Java, SQL and JUnit testing, as well as gaining more experience in working on projects and how to be a good team member.

After that internship, I started working full-time for EMC (Dell EMC). I worked on a storage array sizing tool, improving and updating the configuration and sizing algorithm to cover new features of updated storage arrays. In addition to that, I developed a tool used for generating reports which describe the condition and utilisation of elements and devices of the storage array. This reduced the time of report generation, which had formerly been done manually, from 2 weeks to 5 minutes. During this project, I gained a deep understanding of storage arrays internals and passed the EMC SPEED Performance Guru exam. I also took part in the DellEMC student program as a mentor. 
After Dell EMC, I started working for Cardpay (a FinTech company). Initially, I worked on one of the core payment teams where I developed a reverse-proxy service, responsible for mobile clients’ applications' integrity and security vulnerability checks, and a part Mobile API, which unlocked integrations with Android/iOS applications. This project unblocked the signing of multiple contracts for the company.  I later went on to lead a team of 6 developers/test engineers and 2 analysts on several cross-functional projects, which added support to different payment platforms. This included team and department roadmap planning, team staffing, the mentorship of junior and middle engineers, and cross-team collaboration with Security, Legal, Product and Design teams. Implementing these projects opened new streams of customers from the LATAM and EMEA regions and increased department ARR.

Here I’m going to store my own projects which help me levelling up my skills and learning something new (or just rest and  spend time with pleasure 😅).
